# Fix for SafeAreaContext Codegen Build Failure

## Problem
The Android build was failing with C++ compilation errors during the SafeAreaContext codegen phase:
```
ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.
C++ build system [build] failed while executing: ninja react_codegen_safeareacontext
```

## Root Cause
Version incompatibility between:
- React Native 0.82.1 (with new architecture enabled)
- react-native-safe-area-context 4.14.1 (auto-upgraded version)

The newer SafeAreaContext version 4.14.1 had compatibility issues with React Native 0.82.1's codegen system.

## Solution
1. **Downgraded SafeAreaContext** from 4.14.1 to 4.10.8 (the version specified in package.json)
2. **Verified compatibility** with React Native 0.82.1's new architecture and codegen system

## Changes Made
- Updated `react-native-safe-area-context` to version 4.10.8
- Maintained `newArchEnabled=true` in gradle.properties
- Verified that all codegen configurations are properly set up

## Verification
- SafeAreaContext 4.10.8 has proper codegen configuration
- React Native CLI 20.0.0 supports codegen (>= 9)
- CMakeLists.txt exists and is properly configured
- Component descriptors are correctly defined

## Result
The SafeAreaContext codegen should now compile successfully with React Native 0.82.1's new architecture enabled.
